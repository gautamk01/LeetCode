# üí°My Approach:

# First, build a dictionary (re) to store the frequency of each character in chars.

# For each word in words:
#   Make a copy of the original character dictionary.
#   Check if the word can be formed with the available characters.
#   If successful, add the word's length to the final count.

# Key Logic: Use a frequency map and copy it for each word to validate availability without mutating the original.

# ‚è± Time Complexity: O(m + n * k)
# Where:
# m = length of chars
# n = number of words
# k = average word length

# Space Complexity: O(1) ‚Äì Since character set size is limited (lowercase English letters).
