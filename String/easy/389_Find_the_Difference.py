#  Problem: [389. Find the Difference]
#  Highlight: Given two strings s and t where t has one extra letter, find the added character.

#  My Approach:

#  1. Build a frequency dictionary from string t.
#  2. Loop through each character in s, decreasing the count in the dictionary.
#  3. Remove characters from the dictionary when their count hits zero.
#  4. At the end, the remaining key in the dictionary is the extra character.

# ðŸ“Œ Key Logic: Use a hashmap (dictionary) to track frequency and identify the added character efficiently.

# Time Complexity: O(n) â€“ One pass over each string.
# Space Complexity: O(1) â€“ Limited to lowercase letters (max 26 characters).
